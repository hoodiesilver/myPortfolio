        <p>The way media has portrayed women and children has changed greatly over the last few decades.
        Advertisements used to be able to display images of vulnerable, sexualized, and beaten women in
        order to sell products. The 2009 music video “Stacy’s Mom,” which is by Fountains of Wayne, would be
        very controversial today since it demonstrates these old marketing tactics. This video communicates a
        disturbing message about women (especially mothers) to the band’s audience. The band uses imagery that
        is very prevalent in our culture, such as women being the object of men’s fantasies and younger boys
        ogling older women. The Fountains of Wayne's music video, “Stacy’s Mom,” completely disregards the
        traditional mother-child cultural code by not only fetishizing the mother in an extremely sexual way
        but by also using a child to convey that message.</p>

        <p>In the music video “Stacy’s Mom,” we see a young woman who is believed to be Stacy’s mom. We see
        her picking up a girl, whom we assume to be Stacy, from a crosswalk with a bunch of teenage boys.
        It then transitions to Stacy on her bed in her swimsuit, followed by her going outside to a pool to
        meet a boy. The boy is lounging in the pool watching the mother get undressed, while he completely
        ignores Stacy. The next scene depicts the boy mowing a lawn while Stacy is lounging on a chair watching him.
        Stacy’s mom then comes out in only a towel and gets a massage with the boy ogling her. The following scene is
        the boy and Stacy sitting on the couch together watching TV when the mother comes out to clean. The boy then
        proceeds to stare at her chest while she cleans. The following scene then shows the mom doing a stripper show
        in fishnets and leather (likely imagined by the boy). The final scene shows the boy staring at the mother in
        the pool, looking happy with his eyes closed. The video ends with the daughter walking in on the boy... doing
        something, and immediately leaving the room with a shocked look on her face.</p>

        <p>The major issue within this video is the fact that it breaks the traditional mother-child cultural code
        by showing a teenage boy ogling his friend’s mother. There are multiple situations within this video where
        the boy is supposed to be hanging out with Stacy, but instead he stares at her mother and ignores Stacy. For
        example, in one scene the boy and Stacy are watching something on the TV when Stacy’s mom comes out to clean
        the kitchen. The boy then turns around to watch the mother clean, which shows that he is consciously trying
        to watch the mother. The lyrics reinforce this idea with lines, such as “Stacy, can't you see? You're just not
        the girl for me/I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom” (Fountains of Wayne lines 13-14).
        This shows that he is more interested in the “adult woman” than in kids his age. This music video parallels a
        Diet Pepsi ad described in Jean Kilbourne’s “‘Two Ways a Woman Can Get Hurt’: Advertising and Violence” where
        she describes the commercial as “Cindy Crawford being ogled by two boys (they seemed to be about twelve years
        old) as she got out of her car and bought a Pepsi from a machine” (559). The similarity is young boys gawking
        over older women. Kilbourne argues that these sorts of commercials are dangerous because they are already
        exposing young boys to the sexist dynamic of men and women. In a way, they are communicating that it is okay
        for men to look at women in a sexual (or sexist) manner.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Another aspect that shows this inappropriate relationship would be the sexual innuendos. One of the
        innuendos depicts the mother undressing (which is already inappropriate) while the boy opens an erupting
        bottle of soda. This soda is representing a sexual activity, which is why it is inappropriate to
        communicate that imagery with a kid. Kilbourne discusses how young boys are described in media, stating
        that “many boys grow up feeling that they are unmanly if they are not always ‘ready for action,’ capable
        of and interested in sex with any woman who is available” (563). In accordance with our cultural codes,
        most people agree that twelve-year-old boys are not and should not be “ready for action.” They should not
        be getting any “action” with peers or otherwise. These kinds of topics are not be the “norm” for kids; they
        are goofing off and having fun with their childhood, not trying to have sex. </p>

        <br>

        <p>The other major issue with the video is the objectification of the “Stacy’s Mom” character. There are
        numerous scenes in this video when the camera angles are displaying her in a very sexual light. For
        example, there is a scene in the video where "Stacy’s Mom” pole dances in the boy’s imagination. This is
        very disturbing because that means that at his age, he is already objectifying her (not thinking about her
        as his friend’s mother but a sexual object). As Kilbourne puts it, “Sex in advertising is pornographic
        because it dehumanizes and objectifies people, especially women, and because it fetishizes products,
        imbues them with an erotic charge” (546). While the video is not an advertisement, it imbues the band’s
        music with that erotic charge. With their sexual portrayal of “Stacy’s Mom,” they send a message to their
        audience about their music. This message may be interpreted simply as she is a hot mom or as horrifyingly
        as women are nothing but sexual objects, depending on who is listening.</p>

        <p>Fountains of Wayne defy the traditional mother-child cultural code in a the most inappropriate way
        possible. I would fear the ideas and messages within this video that a child could take away.
        Not only are they showing this one-sided love interest in a mother, but they also blatantly objectify
        her multiple times. However, there is another side to this story. The story is a slice of life about a
        teenage boy going through puberty and seeing his friend’s mom as attractive (Ezzo). The bassist and
        songwriter Adam Schlesinger said in an interview with SongFacts that “[O]ne of my best friends told me
        that he thought my grandmother was really hot, that added a little bit to the song. That’s a true story.
        And my grandmother was pretty hot.” With this being the original meaning behind the band’s song, does that
        mean that the video is okay? Their intentions behind the video do not change the fact the video is
        fundamentally wrong with its portrayal of women and children.</p>
