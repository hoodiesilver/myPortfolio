        <h1>A Little Late with Lilly Singh: A Rhetorical Analysis</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <img src="/images/Lilly-Singh-A-Little-Late-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="A Little Late with Lilly Singh" class="center">
        
        <p>In Margaret Willison's article "Lilly Singh Breaks the Late-Night Show Glass Ceiling but Still
        Has to Tread Carefully," she discusses YouTuber Lilly Singh's new late-night show "A Little Late
        with Lilly Singh." She divulges her interpretation of what she believes will result from Lilly Singh
        's late-night show debut for both the network (NBC) and the late-night show medium. She believes
        that Lilly Singh's presence as a late-night show host is a ground-breaking revelation since all
        the hosts before her were heterosexual, white men, making her a step towards diversity. The
        author's purpose in this article is to inform you about this event and what it could mean for
        late-night show hosts in the future as well as encouraging you to support Singh's show.</p>

        <br>

        <p>First, I want to analyse the author's bias and persona. We can identify the author's bias by
        analysing how she interprets the event as well as analysing her attitude toward Lilly Singh.
        You can see how the author interprets the event when she says, "NBC is making an incredibly
        savvy business decision — as is Singh. NBC gets a shot at Singh's huge audience of young fans,
        and Singh gets access to the budget, staff and clear-cut celebrity of hosting a late-night TV show,"
        (Willison). This shows us that she interprets the event as immensely beneficial for both sides.
        You can also see the positive diction that she uses such as "incredibly savvy," which is a clear
        sign of favouritism/bias. The author's positive attitude towards Singh becomes clear when she
        declares her as "an internationally beloved internet star" (Willison). If she didn't see Lilly
        in a favourable light, she wouldn't use language like that to describe her. In the article, you
        can also observe the author's persona as being liberal and comedic. You can witness her take a
        liberal stance through her choice of evidence. For example, she states, "Since the inception of
        the late-night TV variety show in the 1950s, it has been the domain of middle-aged white men in suits..."
        (Willison). Based on this quote, you can deduct that she is unhappy with the current state of the
        late-night show world because of how nondiverse it is. From this information, we can deduce that she
        wants to see a change in this medium. You can see her comedic style through her diction. Throughout
        the article, you can see her use informal words and phrases for comedic effect. For example, in
        paragraph ten of the article, the author uses the phrase, "... whatever fresh hell we've just experienced,"
        to express her emotions on the topic while making a comedic juxtaposition since you would expect her to
        use more formal language. This also reflects the subject of the article since Lilly Singh is a comedian.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Next, I want to examine the author's audience by both identifying her audience as well as
        determining her desired effect on that audience. Her intended audience was most likely young adults.
        My reasons for believing this is because of the subject of the article and the diction that she uses in
        the article. The subject of the article is a YouTuber and since her demographic is mostly teens and young
        adults, an article published about her is most likely going to be geared towards her followers. The second
        reason is that she uses informal as well as complex language, such as "scrappy underdogs" (Willison) and
        "reflexive pedantry" (Willison). This type of language is most appropriate for young adults since they are
        old enough to know complex words, while still understanding informal slang.  I believe that the effect that
        she wanted to have on her audience is for them to support Lilly Singh. This is because the article is all
        about explaining why Lilly Singh becoming a late-night host is a positive development. For example, the
        author informs, "NBC gets to cloak itself in a positive Glory of Firsts: It now has the only late-night
        network show hosted by a woman, the first hosted by an openly queer person, and the first hosted by a woman
        of color," (Willison). This information encourages people who want more diversity in the late-night show
        medium to support her since she would be bringing that diversity.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Lastly, I'm going to analyse her rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, and logos) and her examples.
          While she doesn't use ethos that much, she uses pathos and logos throughout her article. She mainly
          uses pathos with her comedic remarks, such as in her opening statement when she said, "Late Monday
          night — or very early Tuesday morning, depending on your degree of reflexive pedantry..." (Willison).
          This is pathos since comedic or humorous comments bring out emotions. She uses logos with her analysis
          of Lilly's comedic style and hosting skills. For instance, she analysed Lilly's style as being more on the
          gentle side. She then gave two examples of when she gave jokes that succeeded and failed and stated whether
          they were in Lilly's typical style of comedy. To cite the article, her analysis was, "When working in her
          trademark gentle satire (for instance, classifying ‘Birkenstocks walking across the floor of an REI to buy
          a Patagonia jacket' as a white noise), the jokes succeeded. But when they tried to pivot to serious
          commentary with Wilson claiming that a police siren signals ‘everything is going to be okay,' Singh failed
          to make a retort sharp enough for the satire to land, weakly replying, ‘I don't think everyone feels that way,'"
          (Willison). Her analysis of Lilly's comedic style is exceptionally thorough and thoughtful, which causes you to
          believe her judgment since she seems to be well educated on the matter. Lastly, I'm going to analyse her
          rhetorical appeals and examples. While she doesn't use ethos that much, she uses pathos and logos throughout
          her article. She mainly uses pathos with her comedic remarks, such as in her opening statement when she said,
          "Late Monday night — or very early Tuesday morning, depending on your degree of reflexive pedantry..."
          (Willison). This is pathos since comedic or humorous comments bring out emotions and allows you to see
          the author as a comedic or funny person. She uses logos with her analysis of Lilly's comedic style and
          hosting skills. For instance, she analysed Lilly's style as being more on the gentle side. She then gave
          two examples of when she gave jokes that succeeded and failed and stated whether they were in Lilly's typical
          style of comedy. To cite the article, her analysis was, "When working in her trademark gentle satire
          (for instance, classifying ‘Birkenstocks walking across the floor of an REI to buy a Patagonia jacket'
          as a white noise), the jokes succeeded. But when they tried to pivot to serious commentary with Wilson
          claiming that a police siren signals ‘everything is going to be okay,' Singh failed to make a retort sharp
          enough for the satire to land, weakly replying, ‘I don't think everyone feels that way,'" (Willison).
          Her analysis of Lilly's comedic style is exceptionally thorough and thoughtful, which causes you to believe
          her judgment since she seems to be well educated on the matter. </p>

        <br>

        <p>The way that Margaret Willison reported and analysed the event was well constructed. She started by
        giving us the details of the event in a (fairly) neutral manner which then lead to her opinion on the
        matter. She additionally gave us information on the topics that she was talking about and that strengthened
        her claim. Her word choice and attitude help to promote her argument to her choice audience. She even
        gave critiques on Lilly's comedic dilemma, which made her argument more balanced. While it may have had
        a few unnecessary excerpts, she did an all-around exceptional job with her word choice and rhetorical
        appeals.</p>
